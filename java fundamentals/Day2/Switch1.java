ï‚· Error to Investigate: Why does the compiler complain about duplicate case labels? What 
happens when you have two identical case labels in the same switch block?

 error: duplicate case label
            case 5:

	because both the cases label  are have same value so compiler is confused which to execute and hence gives error for duplicate case label
